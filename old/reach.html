      <!-- University can be a tough time - students are adjusting to a new life outside of their comfort zone.
      But the guiding hand of an experienced mentor can make all the difference. -->
			Your school wants to strengthen the community by encouraging experienced students to connect with new students and help them adjust to campus life.
			<br><br>Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how
			someone may become a mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees.

			<h2> Initial Design Thinking </h2>


      	<ul>
      		<li>University can be scary - it's easy to feel lost and alone for not only new students, but even current students</li>
					<li>Mentorship is a good way to create positive relationships in the student body</li>
      	</ul>

				My design will address the integration and quality of a mentorship experience in the entire student community.
				Through my research, I want to understand what a good mentorship means to both mentors and mentees, as well as the
				challenges they face.<strong> I want to extend the scope of the problem to not just mentorship for newer students,
				but for all students at UofT that may benefit from mentorship.</strong>
				<br><br>

				<strong>Target Users</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>New students to campus</li>
					<li>Students who wish to be mentors</li>
					<li>Students who are not new, but seek mentorship</li>
				</ul>

				<strong>Guiding Questions</strong>
				<br>
				- How can we create <mark>personal, intimate connections</mark> through mentorship?
				<br>
				- How can we engage more students in the mentorship experience?
				<br>
				- How can our design allow students to <mark>easily connect to the right people</mark>, while being inclusive of the entire student body?

			<h3> ✏️ User Interviews </h3>
        To get more clarity on the mindsets and goals of mentors and mentee students, I held open-ended interviews
				with a few mentors and mentees active in the WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) and Industrial Engineering
				mentorship programs. I deliberately used open-ended questions in a more conversational setting to explore more of the problem space.


			<br><br>
			I also met with students who expressed desire to be either a mentor or mentee (but were not at the time)
			to learn what barriers they were facing with the current system.
			<br><br>

			I condensed the findings into general user profiles,
			then summarized and categorized the responses into key issues to help define a problem statement.

			<h3>Insights</h3>

			<div class="wide_tchart">
				<div class="">
				<h4>Mentors</h4>
				Motivations:
			<ul>
				<li>Give mentorship out of feelings of altruism</li>

				<li>Empathize with newer students, they know how it feels and want to help them</li>
				<li>Enjoy seeing their mentee progress</li>
			</ul>
			Challenges:
			<ul>
				<li>Really busy, and mentorship is a big time commitment with current systems</li>
				<li>Sometimes it's not a good match with the mentees</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="">

			<h4>Mentees</h4>
			Motivations:

				<li>Looking for a reliable source of guidance</li>
				<li>Want to meet new people</li>
				<li>Feeling lost/confused about university</li>
			</ul>
			Challenges:

      <!-- <h3> 🤕 Pain Points </h3>
      We want to reduce the challenges users have to their core components, so we can build solutions that solve the problems from the root.
      <br><br>
      Mentorship can be awkward for students. For one, it may be difficult for new students to even seek guidance. Many students related with
      idea of 'You don't know what you don't know'. What do you even want to ask about?

<br><br>
      It can also be difficult to find the right match. Either your mentor doesn't really know how to answer your questions, maybe you don't have the same
      level of commitment in mind, or your schedules never match up - logistics can be hard to figure out. Sometimes, you might feel like you just don't
			click with your mentor/mentee.
<br><br>
			For mentors, there seems to be a high barrier to entry. Mentors have to fill out a detailed form, writing paragraphs about their experience and why they'd
			be a good mentor. Afterwards, they would be interviewed and matched with a mentee. A good question to consider is how can we maintain balance
			between the detail of mentor information and the ease of mentor onboarding. -->

      <h2> Defining the problem </h2>
      Based on the interviews, my understanding of the users, and pain points that were revealed, I scoped the problem space down to a core set of issues
			that the experience should handle.

      <h4>1. Help mentees find mentors that are a good match for them</h4>
			Pain points:
			<ul>
				<li>Mentor not knowing how to answer their questions</li>
				<li>Mentor doesn't have similar experiences to what they're going through</li>
				<li>Mentee feeling like they don't 'click'</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>2. Help mentors easily describe topics they want to mentor about</h4>
		Pain points:
		<ul>
			<li>Long onboarding process for mentors, filling in lots of Q&A</li>
			<li>Don't remember all the things they want to mentor about when signing up</li>
		</ul>

    By being specific and making more detailed profiles, we can better connect the right people together.
		But more details means a trade-off of time and effort - how can we streamline the mentor onboarding
		process while maintaining specificity?
		<h4>3. Balance demand and supply between mentors/mentees</h4>
		Pain points:
		<ul>
			<li>Mentor receving a lot of requests, can feel overwhelming</li>
			<li>Mentor doesn't know which mentees they can actually give good advice to</li>
		</ul>
		<!-- - imbalance of power - mentees may feel like they're asking too much of mentors or being a burden -->
		<!-- - mentors have too many mentees to handle -->
		<!-- <h4>4. Create accountability in both parties</h4>
		Pain points:
		<ul>
			<li>Mentor/meeting bailed on meeting</li>
		</ul> -->
		<!-- - making sure that users are accountable - making mentorship a formal request process
				- mentee sends request and message, while being able to view the mentor's available time commitment , preferred modes of communication
				- mentor can choose to start chatting or accept/decline the invite
		- holding mentors/mentees accountable for agreed meets -->

			<h2> ✨ Design Solution</h2>


			Based on the problem definition, I had a decent idea of the main functionalities that the application should have.
			I outlined a rough task flow in Sketch first.

		<div class='center_text'>
			<!-- <img src="../pics/reach/flow.png", width="100%"> -->

			From there, I fleshed out some wireframe solutions for the main problems. A guiding concept for the design was the idea of
			giving both parties the best information they can use to determine whether a mentor/mentee would be a good fit.
			<br><br>
			<h3>1. Help mentees find mentors that are a good match for them</h3>

			The mentor search system should align with the mental model that mentees have - an example of this is clothing shopping.
			If you're buying clothes, (most) retailers don't divide clothes by colour on their home page. They show you the newest releases
			and general headers for women and men's fashion. Then you can select a type of clothing, like pants or shoes.
			And after that you can filter by colour, size, or specific styles.
			<br><br>
			Similarly, mentees I met with agreed with the following mental model:
			<ol>
				<li>Topic Expertise (finding jobs, academics, social life, clubs)</li>
				<li>Demographics (year, program, cultural background)</li>
				<li>Hobbies and Interests</li>
			</ol>
			I provided two possible flows in the search system - mentees can either view mentors that are matched algorithmically to them, or they can
			manually browse through mentors with specific criteria.
			If they choose to browse, mentees can first filter by topic category and select either the entire category,
			or specific experiences under the topics. After they submit the query, they can browse through the results or further
			filter by demographics or hobbies and interests.
			<br><br>
			As a school with many international students, I believe that it's important to allow filtering by cultural background. International
			students especially, report high rates of depression and loneliness - this can help them find students who they can better relate to and
			connect with.
			<br><br>

			During the onboarding process, I streamlined the mentor profile writing with a few concepts.
			<ol>
				<li>Providing general topics as prompts</li>
				<li>Pre-written, common experiences they can select</li>
				<li>Writing their own experiences as a last resort</li>
				<li>Leaving scheduling and more detailed inputs for later on</li>
			</ol>

			By providing topic prompts instead of just asking them to write their expertise from scratch,
			we're lowering the user's activation energy and also reminding them of experiences they might
			have not remembered otherwise.

			Specificity is also important in this case. It's much more useful to a mentee to see that a mentor is 'experienced in navigating group projects'
			rather than 'academics'.

			In most of the mentorship programs I interacted with, there were more mentees than mentors. Mentors are dealing with a lot
			of mentorship requests, so my goal is to design a request process where mentors can easily assess which requests would be the best fit, and
			mentees are encouraged to send requests specifying what they want to learn from a mentor. This will give mentors a better idea of whether
			they can teach a mentee what they want to know, and also deter mentees from mass-sending requests by increasing the effort required to send one.

	<h3> Go-to-Market </h3>

	For an experience like this to be successful on a larger scale, we'll need
	to cement <mark>student-to-student mentorship as a keystone of the UofT culture</mark>.

	We can make finding mentorship/meeting with mentors part of the curriculum for introductory
	university courses, and reward mentors with co-curricular credits for participating in the app.



	<br><br><br><br>
	<h2>Future work</h2>

Design work can always be improved on. Some possible directions:

<ul>
	<li><h4>Improving the meetup experience</h4>

		Since students have a fairly consistent weekly schedule, we can allow students to upload their calendars and easily pick
		times that work for both parties to use for mentoring
		<br><br>
		Maps for meeting on campus - new students may have trouble finding their way around, it would be helpful to have some
		interactive layout of the school for picking meetup locations
		<br><br>

		Video calling, Phone calling


	</li>
	<li><h4>Group mentorship</h4>
		Creating small groups of 3-4 mentees who have similar interests, and connecting them with one mentor.
		This would ease the demand and supply imbalance, while also creating more mentee-mentee connections.

	</li>

	<li><h4>Mentorship events</h4>
		Co-ordinate live mentorship events that involve fun activities, or have ice-breaker events like a mixer
		where mentors and mentees can find each-other.

	</li>
</ul>


			<!-- <h3> 🤔 Learnings and Reflections </h3>

			This experience really pushed the importance of good, regular communication in design work. I think in a startup, it can be tempting to just pump through tasks for the sake of completion, but I realized that establishing a strong cross-team collaboration mindset is immensely beneficial.
			<br><br>

			Involving PMs and developers more throughout the process would have helped us avoid bumps like miscommunication about the feasibility of certain features, or the small issues arising that led us astray from the design.

			<br><br>
			As a designer I also learned to be more detailed in how I pass on my designs - every screen should have a few copies of how they would look on different sizes, edge cases like really long text boxes or empty states also need to be designed since people do not read minds - just cause' I know how it looks, if it's not visible, there's no guarantee that it'll turn out how it's expected to be. -->
