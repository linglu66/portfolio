				<p>The mentor search system should align with the mental model that mentees have  with regards to finding a good match. 
					<br><br>

						- Demographics (year, program, cultural background)
						- Hobbies and Interests</p>

						I provided two possible flows in the search system - mentees can either view mentors that are

						<br><br>
						As a school with many international students, I believe that it's important to allow filtering by
						cultural background. International students especially, report high rates of depression and
						loneliness - this can help them find students who they can better relate to and connect with.

				By providing topic prompts instead of just asking them to write their expertise from scratch, we're
					lowering the user's activation energy and also reminding them of experiences they might have not
					remembered otherwise. Specificity is also important in this case. It's much more useful to a mentee
					to see that a mentor is 'experienced in navigating group projects' rather than 'academics'.</p>

					In most of the mentorship programs I saw, there were more mentees than mentors.
