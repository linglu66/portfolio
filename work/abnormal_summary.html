		I joined Abnormal Security as the second designer. During my time there, I have gained valuable insights, including:
		<br>
			<ul>
			<li>How to keep cross-functional teams in sync</li>
			<li>How to collaborate with leadership and exchange ideas productively</li>
			<li>Moving fast and staying flexible</li>
			<li>What a customer-first approach looks like</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			My projects have ranged from internal to external, and have included improvements to 0-1 projects. I have driven user research projects and established templates and best practices for our team, including PM/Design collaboration, user research, and design hiring practices. <span class="bold">Most of my work is NDA, this case study only summarizes my time here.</span>

				<h3 class ="white_text">Thoroughly understand users</h3>
				<p>For every project, I made sure to gain a deep understanding of our users and their interests, issues, and edge cases. To achieve this, I conducted direct user research, often with the help of our PM to establish a research plan, conducted research, and synthesized the results.

					<br><br>
				I also greatly valued the insights our Customer Success representatives provided. 

				They worked very closely with our customers and were often privy to issues that no one else knew. By talking to them, I gained a better understanding of our customers' needs and could ensure that our products met those needs.</p>
